= RELEASE HISTORY

== 0.4.0 / 2009-06-06

This version of English (v0.4.0) is the first step in a two part
process to scale the library back to it's "pure English" roots.
With limited exceptions, library scripts that are not strictly related
to providing routines for working with the English language will be
deprecated. Any useful deprecated functionality will most likely be
supported  in Ruby Facets instead.

Changes:

* 3 Major Enhancements

  * dresner.rb and jumble.rb are deprecated (use obfuscate.rb instead).
  * string.rb has been renamed words.rb
  * created namecase.rb (used to be in case.rb)


== 0.3.0 / 2008-09-27

English's Inflect performance has been greatly improved.
Inflect had used sorting and a comparision loop to find matches
for singular and plural conversions. Now it uses a single Regexp
which handles all the matching grunt work on it's own and
provides a 10x performance gain! Thanks goes to Wycats
for this superb work on this.

English has also gained a new Style module which extends the
String class. This mixin provides an assortment of String
alteration methods such as titlecase, jumble, pathize, etc;
all the ones you would expect and then some.

Changes:

* 3 Major Enhancements

    * Applied wycats improvements to inflect.rb. Now 10x faster!
    * Renamed database.rb to orm.rb and metacode.rb to code.rb.
    * Added style.rb from Facets.

* 5 Minor Enhancements

    * Added warning to old jumble.rb and dresner.rb.
    * Added rule 'ess', 'esses' to inflect.rb.
    * Fixed vertex plural.
    * Fixed similarity require.
    * Minor adjustments to English::Filter.


== 0.2.0 / 2008-02-07

Continued work in general orginaization, deciding what will and will not
be included, what the best names for things are, etc.

== 0.1.0 / 2007-08-01

together.
